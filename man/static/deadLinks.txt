Dead Links From The OpenCL Reference Pages

== Description

If you've arrived at this page by following a link in the OpenCL 2.2
Reference Pages, the reason is that an automatically generated
cross-reference was created, even though the cross-reference target is not
part of the OpenCL 2.2 specifications. Details are explained individually
below for each such link.

                                  the 2.2 Specification did not document
                                  this function.
